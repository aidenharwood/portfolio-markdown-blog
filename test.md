# Exploring Azure: Practical Scenarios and Code Samples

Azure is a powerful cloud platform offering a wide range of services for developers and IT professionals. In this post, we'll walk through practical scenarios, configuration examples, and code snippets to help you get started with Azure.

## Inline Code

When working with Azure CLI, you can quickly create a resource group using:

```bash
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

## YAML Example

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates use YAML or JSON to define infrastructure. Here’s a sample configuration for deploying resources:

```yaml
resources:
    - type: Microsoft.Web/sites
        apiVersion: 2021-02-01
        name: myWebApp
        location: eastus
        properties:
            serverFarmId: myAppServicePlan
```

## C# Example

You can interact with Azure services using the Azure SDK for .NET. For example, to write a message to Azure Application Insights:

```cs
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;

public class Example
{
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
                var telemetry = new TelemetryClient();
                telemetry.TrackTrace("Application started successfully.");
        }
}
```

## Perl Example

Automation scripts can also be written in Perl to interact with Azure REST APIs:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use LWP::UserAgent;

my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
my $response = $ua->get('https://management.azure.com/subscriptions?api-version=2020-01-01');

print $response->decoded_content;
```
